# Introduction
The *Amygdala* corresponds to the part of the brain that is responsible for the processing of memory and the making of decisions.

This project aims to demonstrate how neural networks work through a simple, clean, and easy to understand code structure. A visualisation GUI also helps understanding how the data is processed within such structure, and parameters can be adjusted in order to understand from the basics, to more advanced calculations.
